        <h2 class="top-red">Good Direct Marketers Use Cogent,<br>
            Well-Reasoned Program Strategies And<br>
            Get Them Approved Internally Before<br>
            They Engage Outside Resources. </h2>
        <span>By Bob Hacker</span>
        <p>Written plans — this is how you control internal and external teams. Get all the team input you need, and then write a campaign brief.
        </p>
        <p>Get the brief approved by the internal team before you give it to your agency or vendor.  (If you don’t have time to write it, make your agency or vendor do it, then get it approved internally before you start creative development.)</p>
        <p>The plan forces the team to get it right before you start burning time and money.  This document also becomes the touchstone you use to bring both internal and external resources back to focus on the specific mission.  If a team member goes off on a tangent, use the document to put them back on point.  If goals or objectives start to shift, use the plan to re-focus them back to the agreed upon goal set or force them to support their recommended change with a written argument which then becomes the new program touchstone.</p>
        <p>The fastest, highest performing and least painful programs we do always start this way. Always.</p>
        <p>And still we see very few formal campaign briefs these days, well written or not.</p>
        <p>A few years ago, I did an audit.   We did about 540 campaigns that year.  I went to our account management team and asked them how many started with a well-written brief.  The answer was four (4).  We wrote the other 536 since we won’t start the work without one.
        </p>
        <p>It’s crazy to let your agency control the strategy — that should be the client’s job.  No agency can be close enough to the inner workings of the sales process to get all the detail right.  Remember, the client controls the sales process, not the agency or vendor, and more campaigns flop because of poor backend implementation than poor front-end performance.
        </p>
        <p>If I were a VP of Sales & Marketing again, I wouldn’t hire anybody who couldn’t or wouldn’t write a cogent brief for every new campaign.  And I’d pay dearly for somebody who could and would do it right.  Without that document the chance of error, wasted time and money is just too high.</p>
